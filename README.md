# First Pipeline Challenge

# About

This project was created as part of the First Pipeline Challenge where the goal was to build a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Instead of manually testing, building, and deploying our application, we automated the entire process.

Every push to the repository now triggers a workflow that installs dependencies, runs automated tests, builds a Docker container, scans for security vulnerabilities, and deploys the app automatically

Live Application


# CI/CD Pipeline Flow

1. Code pushed to main branch
2. GitHub Actions runner starts automatically
3. Node.js environment is created
4.  Dependencies installed with npm
5. Tests run against /status endpoint
6. Docker image built from Dockerfile
7. Trivy scans container for vulnerabilities
8. Render auto-deploys updated version


# Docker

We use Docker to ensure the application runs consistently across environments.

Build locally:

docker build -t the-pipe .
docker run -p 3001:3001 the-pipe


# Security Scanning 

Trivy scans our container image for known vulnerabilities.

Important:

Vulnerabilities may still appear — this is normal.

The goal is to monitor and understand potential risks.


# Running Locally


Install dependencies:

npm install


Run tests:

npm test


Start server:

npm start


# Team Motto 💖

Push with confidence. Let the pipeline handle the chaos.
